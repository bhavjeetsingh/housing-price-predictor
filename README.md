📈 Multivariable Regression and Valuation Model
This project builds and evaluates a multivariable regression model for estimating the valuation of companies based on financial and non-financial metrics. The model leverages historical data, statistical techniques, and visualization to provide actionable insights into valuation drivers.

🔍 Project Overview
The notebook includes the following steps:

Data loading and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering and selection

Multivariable regression modeling

Model evaluation and interpretation

Valuation prediction for selected companies
